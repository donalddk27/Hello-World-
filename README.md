A Little about myself, I don't know where to start learning. I feel like all these things that I want to learn are all interconnected with eachoether, right? So, when I go to learn about one subject it starts trying to teach me something that I must have previous knowledge of something else for. Leading me to go find out what I have to know to learn this thing that I really want to know, but in that search loop, it continues. I would like to learn to code in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Rails, and Python. As well as other languages if I can manage to figure out the ones just mentioned. I would like to be involved in a community of tech individuals where we could learn and expand on eachothers knowledge. I must admit though, I dont know much. I would also like to help other people trying to learn the same things I am trying to learn because in my search I have not yet found a way to understand all of these new and abstract concepts because of my way of different thinking. I think that i probably just read into it too much. Like trying to listen to life give me some of its secrets to make it easier, but it never REALLY is. I would be happy to be friends with anyone reading this.
